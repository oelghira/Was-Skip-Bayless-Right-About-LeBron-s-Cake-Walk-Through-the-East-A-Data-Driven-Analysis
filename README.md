# Was Skip Bayless Right About LeBron's "Cake-Walk" Through the East?: A Data-Driven Analysis :cake:  
#### Omar El-Ghirani | December 17th, 2024  
 It’s true that 2 things can be true at once. It’s true that LeBron James is a historically great talent on the basketball court. If you ask Skip Bayless, it’s also true that LeBron had a “cake-walk” through the Eastern Conference to reach his first 9 appearances in the NBA finals. I’ve listened to Skip talk “cake-walk” and LeBron James for years. I happened to love a great debate as much as a great basketball game. Skip has been critical of LeBron’s career since his first day as a professional. Skip is often critical, cold, and calculated based off what he calls his "eye test". The statistician in me has always wondered if Skip actually sees something we don’t in LeBron’s game. I’ve always wondered how does Skip see a “cake-walk” instead of pure greatness? In this analysis I will translate Skip's "cake-walk" talk into measurable terms and finally settle whether or not LeBron James had a "cake-walk" in the Eastern Conference.  

**Spoiler Alert: Skip has a point to make about LeBron’s trips to the Finals in the East.**  

## How To Translate A "Cake-Walk" Into Analytics We Can Measure :bar_chart:
Skip never defines what he means by a "cake-walk". We can interpret it as LeBron had an easier path to the finals by playing in the Eastern Conference instead of the Western Conference. Translating this into terms we can validate using statistics and data, an easier path to the finals would mean we would see these 3 measureable events:
  1) Teams in the Western Conference regularly beat teams in the Eastern Conference
  2) Bottom seeded Western Conference playoff teams could beat top seeded Eastern Conference playoff teams 
  3) LeBron lost more to Western Conference playoff teams than Eastern Conference playoff teams

## A Brief List of LeBron's Career Accolades :trophy:
If you don't know who LeBron James is, I'm sure you have heard his name. He's one of the most accomplished players to ever dribble a ball in the NBA and for good reason. If you google him, you'll find much more than I can list here. A small list of what he has achieved to date are:
  - 4x NBA Champion (2012, 2013, 2016, 2020)
  - 4x NBA Finals MVP (2012, 2013, 2016, 2020)
  - 4x NBA MVP (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013)
  - 13x NBA First Team Selection
  - 5x NBA All-Defense First Team Selection
  - NBA Rookie Of The Year
  - All Time Leading Scorer in the NBA

## 1. Did teams in the West regularly beat teams in the East during LBJ's run? 
A picture is worth a thousand words, so we'll first look at which conference came out on top in East vs West games.  
<br/> 
![image 1 - East vs West](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2f2b12-31e4-4eb4-8c75-88273611dfa1)
<br/>  
Looking at regular season matchups of Western Conference teams vs Eastern Conference teams, the West won more than 50% of games in 14 out of the 15 years of LBJ's career in the East. The only exception was the 2008-2009 season (2009 szn on the chart above) where the East managed to just barely win more than 50% of games against the West. In LeBron's 15 years in the East, the West won 56.6% of head to head matchups against teams in the East. Skip's "eye test" seems to have some credibility and there isn't much room for debate on this point. This confirms the first layer in our "cake-walk" analysis and shows the West was the better conference in the regular season.  

## 2. The West won the regular season matchups, but how lopsided was it? Could the bottom of the West beat the best of the East?
The playoffs is where we really get to see which team, in a best of 7 game competition, is truly the better team. The only problem for us is that we want to compare the two conferences and they don't play eachother in the playoffs until the finals. The best we can do is focus our comparison from conference against conference to playoff teams against playoff teams. 
<br/>  
![image 2 1 - East vs West Playoffs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17467276-7318-4ad3-bc9b-8936def07da1)
<br/>  
The chart above paints an even clearer picture that the West's top teams won much more against the East's top contenders in every year Lebron James played in the Eastern Conference. In our first comparison of every team in the West playing against every teams in the East, the West won an average of 56.6%. When we narrow our focus to the top 8 teams in the West against the top 8 teams in the East, the West's annual average win percentage increases to 58.2%. Translating that into English, that bump in annual win percentage from 56.6% to 58.2% means the West's playoff teams won slightly more than 2 games a year against the East's playoff teams than the entire Western Conference playing against the entire Eastern Conference. The data seems to give us a clearer view of what Skip must have seen with his "eye test". But before we can confirm the second layer in this analysis, we should ask ourselves if the West was truly dominant, then wouldn't the bottom 4 playoff teams in the West beat the top 4 playoff teams in the East?  
<br/>  
![image 2 2 - East vs West Playoffs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78bf18fe-67e3-4e65-9069-785065d1d729)
<br/>  
The chart above is almost like the icing on the cake. Comparing the West's bottom 4 seeds against the East's top 4 seeds, the average annual win percentage by the bottom 4 playoff teams is 59.9%! That's more than the entire West won against all of the East on a yearly basis and more than all Western playoff teams playing against all Eastern playoff teams annually. We could also compare top 4 seed against top 4 seed in each conference, but that seems like overkill at this point. Skip's analysis of LeBron having a "cake-walk" through 15 seasons in the East seems right on the money. The data does not lie to us. The competition LeBron went through to get to the NBA Finals 9 times out of the East was not as difficult as the path the Golden State Warriors, San Antonio Spurs, OKC Thunder, or Dallas Mavericks had to take. 

With this in mind, I want to remind us that a "cake-walk" would not even be a question asked if one man hadn't accomplished so much that we had to wonder how was it possible? LeBron is an exceptional player, so before we conclude that Skip was right this whole time and LeBron really had a "cake-walk" to the Finals we need to focus on how he and his teams compared to the tougher Western Conference.  

## 3. So Did LeBron's teams lose more to the West than the East?
![image 3 1 4 - lbj west conf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/504d221d-b007-4172-ba46-e06e293a589c)  
At first glance, it is easy to see that LeBron won at least 50% of his games against the tougher Western conference except for his very first year in league in the 2003-2004 season (2004 szn above). This isn't surprising. LeBron is clearly an exceptional player. But when we shift our focus to LeBron vs the top 4 teams in the West, the story is much more interesting.

![image 4 2 - lbj west top 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/824a6a2d-fa73-461f-bff8-ebf3efe93131)
LeBron's win percentage builds up from his first season in the league to his peak in the 2012-2013 season (2013 szn above) then starts to decline until his final years in the East resemble his earliest years as a professional. There's many ways to describe what we are seeing. One version of the story is as LeBron progressed in the league his win percentage against the best teams improved. Then his win percentage against the top Western teams decreased once he teamed up with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami until they figured out how to maximize thier talents. LeBron in Miami reached his peak winning percentage in 2012-2013 season, then decreased and held steady as he switched teams until his final years in Cleveland where he saved as much as possible for the playoffs. You could also tell a story for each invidivual season and his different team mates and their experience and age. One thing that is indisputable is that LeBron's average win percentage against the top 4 teams in the West was 48%. Excluding his first year his average jumps to 50%.  

Before making a conclusion on whether or not LeBron "cake-walked" through the East we will compare how his teams and the NBA champ performed against the top seeds in the West. 
![image 5 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3edda738-fb34-40a7-a948-d437cd619b5a)
In the 15 seasons LeBron played in the East, he either won the championship or outplayed the eventual champ in 8 out of 15 years against the top 4 teams in the West (represented by the circled points above). 

## Conclusion
After taking a deep dive into this we can conclude that in LeBron's 15 years playing in the Eastern Conference:
1) The teams in the West regularly won more than 50% of thier games against teams in the East (i.e. the West won more playing the East, than the East did playing the West).
2) The bottom 4 playoff seeds in the West won nearly 60% of thier games against the top 4 teams in the East (i.e. the top contenders in the East wouldn't have gone far in the Western Conference playoffs).
3) LeBron regualy won more than 50% of games against the entire Western Conference and just shy of 50% against the top 4 teams in the Western Conference playoffs (i.e. no matter which conference LeBron played in, he was contender).

So we have to give Skip credit that he was right that LeBron had an advantage in reaching the finals 9 times by playing in the easier Eastern Conference. We could dive further into this but it seems pretty clear, if the definition of a "cake-walk" is the easier of the 2 paths to the finals, then LeBron "cake-walked" there 9 times and won 3 of those trips. :cake:
